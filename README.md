# JetsonGPIO(C++)
A C++ library that enables the use of Jetson's GPIOs  

==========================================================================  
This is a very simple C++ Jetson GPIO Library written by Jueon Park(pjueon).   
It has been written in C++ based on NVIDIA's Jetson-GPIO Python Library.  
(https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio)  
It has almost same API with the NVIDIA's python library.   
But it DOESN'T support all functionalites of the NVIDIA's original one.   

It's not fully tested yet.
