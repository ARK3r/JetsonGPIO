# JetsonGPIO (C++)
`JetsonGPIO` is an unofficial C++ version of the [NVIDIA's `Jetson.GPIO` Python library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio).

NVIDIA Jetson series development boards contain a 40 pin GPIO header, similar to the 40 pin header in the Raspberry Pi. These GPIOs can be controlled for digital input and output using this library. `JetsonGPIO` provides C++ APIs that are almost same as the `Jetson.GPIO` Python library.
